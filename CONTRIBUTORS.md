## 4. Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**: Click the fork button at the top of this page to make a copy of the repo in your GitHub account.
2. **Clone Your Fork**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/HausaMediaLab.git
   ```
3. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # For Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 5. Contribution Workflow

To maintain code quality and avoid conflicts, please follow these steps:

1. **Sync Your Fork**: Always ensure your fork is up-to-date with the main repository.
2. **Create a New Branch**: Use descriptive names for your branches, such as `add-feature-X` or `fix-bug-Y`.
   ```bash
   git checkout -b add-feature-X
   ```
3. **Make Your Changes**: Write code and tests as required.
4. **Write Tests**: If adding a new feature, include tests in the `tests` folder.
5. **Commit Changes**: Write meaningful commit messages. Follow this format:
   ```
   [MODULE] Brief description of the change
   ```
6. **Push and Submit a Pull Request**:
   ```bash
   git push origin add-feature-X
   ```

After pushing, navigate to the **Pull Requests** tab on GitHub and submit a new pull request.

## 6. Development Guidelines

- **Write Clean Code**: Follow Python best practices and keep code modular.
- **Document Functions**: Include docstrings to explain each function’s purpose, parameters, and return values.
- **Optimize for Efficiency**: Optimize code for speed and memory where possible, especially in media processing functions.

## 7. Submitting Your Contribution

Once you’re satisfied with your code and have run tests locally:

1. **Check for Merge Conflicts**: Ensure your branch can merge into the `main` branch without conflicts.
2. **Submit a Pull Request** (PR): Explain your changes, referencing any relevant issue numbers.

A maintainer will review your PR, suggest any improvements, and, once approved, merge it into the main branch.

## 8. Reporting Issues

If you find any issues or bugs, please:
1. Open an issue in the **Issues** tab.
2. Include a clear, descriptive title.
3. Provide details: steps to reproduce, expected outcome, actual outcome, and relevant screenshots or logs if applicable.

## 9. Style Guide

We follow the [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guide. A few important points:
- **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces for indentation.
- **Naming**: Use `snake_case` for functions and variables, and `PascalCase` for classes.
- **Docstrings**: Use triple quotes for function documentation, following the PEP 257 conventions.
